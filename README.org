* Semira's music

** What is this?

   A simple application to stream audio from your server to your browser
   for listening.  It provides a HTML5 frontend to audio files (MP3,
   FLAC, Ogg Vorbis/Opus, M4A) for searching and playing.  The files are
   recoded before streaming them to save bandwidth and be compatible with
   the browser you are using.

** How does it work?

   This application is build using Clojure and ClojureScript to handle
   user requests and uses GStreamer to recode audio files.  The recoded
   audio files are cached for later use.

** Installation

   The source directory includes a Dockerfile to build a [[https://www.docker.io/][docker]] image;

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   lein uberjar
   docker build -t semira .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $HOME/Music:/home/app/Music:ro semira
   #+END_SRC

   When Jetty reports it is listening on port 8080, hit the [[http://localhost:8080/update][/update]]
   location to index the MP3, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis/Opus and M4A files in your
   home Music directory.  The ~/update~ location will redirect to ~/~
   after a few seconds while the indexer continues to collect the audio
   meta data; newly collected data will not show up until reload.
